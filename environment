# ~/.environment $Revision: 1.4 $
#
# This is a confuration file for path, umask, and other personal environment
# settings. It is loaded from the default ~/.cshrc.
#
# Your file creation mask is set, default environment variables are set, and
# platform-independent bin and man directories (e.g.  ~/bin, ~/bin.Linux or
# ~/bin.SunOS, if they exist) are added to your path.
#
# The shell treats lines beginning with # as comments.
#
# EDIT THIS FILE to modify your path or umask and to modify your environment
# variables.  If you don't know what something in here does, you should
# probably leave it alone.
#
# YOU SHOULD USE ONLY THE HOOK COMMANDS in this file so that it will work
# from all supported shells. Refer to hooks(7) for a command listing.
#

#
# The umask controls the permissions inherited by new files created from a
# shell or a child process. here's a table of some umask values you might
# use. See also tcsh(1) and chmod(1).
#
# note that files created from xemacs will have the umask of the process
# that started xemacs, so for the safest behavior, set your umask and then
# start xemacs from a shell, or create new files in the shell. see touch(1).
